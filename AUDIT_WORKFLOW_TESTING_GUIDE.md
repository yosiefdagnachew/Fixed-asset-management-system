# ðŸ§ª Audit Workflow System - Complete Testing Guide

## **Prerequisites**
- âœ… Development server running (`npm run dev`)
- âœ… Database migrated with new audit workflow tables
- âœ… At least 3 users with different roles (ADMIN, MANAGER, USER)
- âœ… Some assets in the system to audit

## **Phase 1: Database Verification**

### **1.1 Check New Tables in Prisma Studio**
1. Open Prisma Studio: `npx prisma studio` (http://localhost:5555)
2. Verify these new tables exist:
   - âœ… `AuditAssignment`
   - âœ… `AuditRequest` 
   - âœ… `AssetAudit` (updated with new fields)

### **1.2 Check Updated AssetAudit Model**
In Prisma Studio, check `AssetAudit` table has new fields:
- âœ… `auditorId` (String?)
- âœ… `workflowStatus` (AuditWorkflowStatus)
- âœ… `assignmentId` (String?)
- âœ… `requestId` (String?)
- âœ… `reviewedBy` (String?)
- âœ… `reviewedAt` (DateTime?)
- âœ… `reviewNotes` (String?)
- âœ… `managerApproval` (Boolean?)

## **Phase 2: API Endpoint Testing**

### **2.1 Test Audit Assignments API**

#### **GET /api/audit-assignments**
```bash
# Test as different roles
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/audit-assignments" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

#### **POST /api/audit-assignments (Manager/Admin only)**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/audit-assignments" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_MANAGER_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "assetId": "ASSET_ID_HERE",
    "assignedToId": "USER_ID_HERE",
    "title": "Monthly Asset Audit",
    "description": "Routine monthly audit for compliance",
    "priority": "MEDIUM",
    "dueDate": "2024-06-01T00:00:00Z",

  }'
```

### **2.2 Test Audit Requests API**

#### **POST /api/audit-requests (Any role)**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/audit-requests" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: next-auth.session-token=YOUR_USER_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "assetId": "ASSET_ID_HERE",
    "title": "Suspected Damage Audit",
    "reason": "Asset appears damaged, needs inspection",
    "urgency": "HIGH",
    "requestedDate": "2024-05-25T00:00:00Z",
    "description": "Found scratches on the equipment"
  }'
```

## **Phase 3: Frontend Testing**

### **3.1 Navigation Testing**
1. **Login as different roles** and verify navigation:
   - âœ… USER: Should see "Audits" in navigation
   - âœ… MANAGER: Should see "Audits" in navigation  
   - âœ… ADMIN: Should see "Audits" in navigation

2. **Click "Audits" link** â†’ Should navigate to `/audits/workflow`

### **3.2 Audit Workflow Page Testing**

#### **As USER Role:**
1. **View Assignments Tab:**
   - âœ… Should only see assignments assigned to them
   - âœ… Should see "No audit assignments found" if none exist
   - âœ… Can search and filter assignments

2. **View Requests Tab:**
   - âœ… Should only see requests they created
   - âœ… Should see "No audit requests found" if none exist
   - âœ… Can search and filter requests

#### **As MANAGER Role:**
1. **View Assignments Tab:**
   - âœ… Should see assignments they created
   - âœ… Should see "New Assignment" button
   - âœ… Can search and filter assignments

2. **View Requests Tab:**
   - âœ… Should see requests assigned to them for review
   - âœ… Should see unassigned requests they can claim
   - âœ… Can search and filter requests

#### **As ADMIN Role:**
1. **View Both Tabs:**
   - âœ… Should see all assignments and requests system-wide
   - âœ… Should see "New Assignment" button
   - âœ… Can search and filter all data

## **Phase 4: Workflow Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Manager-Initiated Audit Assignment**

#### **Step 1: Manager Creates Assignment**
1. Login as **MANAGER**
2. Go to `/audits/workflow`
3. Click "Assignments" tab
4. Click "New Assignment" button (TODO: implement modal)
5. Fill assignment details and submit

#### **Step 2: User Accepts Assignment**
1. Login as **USER** (assigned auditor)
2. Go to `/audits/workflow`
3. See the assignment in "Assignments" tab
4. Click assignment to view details (TODO: implement detail page)
5. Accept the assignment

#### **Step 3: User Performs Audit**
1. User starts the audit
2. User completes audit and submits for review
3. Manager reviews and approves/rejects

### **Scenario 2: User-Initiated Audit Request**

#### **Step 1: User Creates Request**
1. Login as **USER**
2. Go to `/audits/workflow`
3. Click "Requests" tab
4. Click "New Request" button (TODO: implement modal)
5. Fill request details and submit

#### **Step 2: Manager Reviews Request**
1. Login as **MANAGER**
2. Go to `/audits/workflow`
3. See the request in "Requests" tab
4. Click request to view details (TODO: implement detail page)
5. Approve or reject the request

#### **Step 3: User Performs Audit (if approved)**
1. User performs audit from approved request
2. Manager reviews final audit results

## **Phase 5: Integration Testing**

### **5.1 Test with Existing Audit Reports**
1. Create some audit assignments and requests
2. Complete a few audits through the workflow
3. Go to `/reports/audits`
4. Verify the new audits appear in reports
5. Check that workflow status is reflected in analytics

### **5.2 Test Role-Based Access Control**
1. **Try accessing APIs with wrong roles:**
   - USER trying to create assignments (should fail)
   - USER trying to approve requests (should fail)
   - MANAGER trying to access other manager's assignments (should fail)

2. **Test UI role restrictions:**
   - USER should not see "New Assignment" button
   - Different roles should see different data sets

## **Phase 6: Error Handling Testing**

### **6.1 API Error Testing**
```bash
# Test invalid asset ID
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/audit-assignments" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"assetId": "invalid-id", "assignedToId": "user-id", "title": "Test"}'

# Test missing required fields
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/audit-assignments" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test"}'

# Test unauthorized access
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/audit-assignments" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  # (without authentication)
```

### **6.2 Frontend Error Testing**
1. **Test with no data:**
   - Empty assignments list
   - Empty requests list
   - Loading states

2. **Test network errors:**
   - Disconnect internet and try to load page
   - Verify error messages display properly

## **Phase 7: Performance Testing**

### **7.1 Load Testing**
1. Create multiple assignments and requests
2. Test page load times with large datasets
3. Test search and filter performance

### **7.2 Database Performance**
1. Check query performance in terminal logs
2. Verify proper indexing on new tables
3. Test with realistic data volumes
